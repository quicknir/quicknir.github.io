##### I'm just this guy, you know?

My name's Nir Friedman. I did an undergrad in Engineering Physics at University of Toronto and a PhD in Physics at University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign. Now I do software engineering in New York City. I'm interested in many things software and math related, especially C++, python, software design, probability, machine learning, stats, and data analysis.

I write my blog to help me develop my ideas, to share them, and get feedback on them. Feel free to comment on my posts with criticism, praise, suggestions, improvements, or nearly anything else.
