title: What Every *nix C++ dev should know about globals
author: Nir Friedman and Sandeep Kumar Gupta
---

Doing a global correctly in C++ is not a trivial thing, when the global itself
is non-trivial. Or, put another way: globals that have constructors and
destructors can easily make a big mess. There's surprisingly few resources
summarizing exactly what considerations are relevant in order to make sure
globals behave themselves. There are some well known cases, like static
initialization order fiasco (SIOF). Maybe this is because to really talk about
globals, we have to talk about the linker, and the linker is a strange beast.
Without it, you can't write any real C++ program, but it's not covered by the
standard, its behavior is relatively rarely discussed, and varies from platform
to platform.

## A motivating example

Consider the following example code; comments with `<>` inside are used to
indicate a filename:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
// <static.h>
#pragma once

#include <string>

extern std::string g_str;

// <static.cpp>
#include "static.h"

std::string g_str = "hello for a really really";

// <dynamic.h>
#pragma once

#include "static.h"

#include <string>

std::string globalGetter();

// <dynamic.cpp>
#include "dynamic.h"
#include "static.h"

std::string globalGetter() {
    return g_str;
}

// <main.x.cpp>
#include "static.h"
#include "dynamic.h"

#include <iostream>

int main() {
    std::cerr << g_str << "\n";
    std::cerr << globalGetter() << "\n";
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

As you might guess, this code represents a static library, a shared (or dynamic,
I will use the terms interchangeably) library, and a main executable. There's a
global object in the static library, used in the shared library and in the
executable.

There are three translation units (TUs) here, one for each file ending in
`.cpp`. As far as a compiler is concerned, all of these translation units are
kosher. Let's try to link this together and see what happens:

{% highlight bash linenos %}
# Compile static translation unit
clang++ -std=c++14 -c -fpic static.cpp
# Produce a static library
ar rcs libstatic.a static.o
# Compile dynamic translation unit
clang++ -std=c++14 -c -fpic dynamic.cpp
# Produce dynamic library, linking against static
clang++ -shared -o libdynamic.so dynamic.o -L./ -lstatic
# Compile main executable translation unit
clang++ -std=c++14 -c main.x.cpp
# Link executable against shared and static libraries
clang++ -L./ -Wl,-rpath=./ main.x.o -lstatic -ldynamic
{% endhighlight %}

I'll get into more details later, for me, running the resulting executable
results in a segfault. If you ever use globals and are surprised at this
segfaulting, read on. And by the way: class static variables are just scoped
global variables; and are susceptible to all the same problems.

## What this post is not

Before I continue, there's a few caveats about this post.

The first is that this post is not designed to teach you about the linker for
its own sake. If you want to learn more about the linker, then by all means
there are good posts out [there](eli bendersky link). Most developers are not
experts on the linker but have working knowledge that lets them do what they
need to do. That's the goal here: to understand enough to use globals safely.

Second, this article is not in any way an endorsement of using globals, as a
general technique. Quite the opposite: these issues should only highlight how
tricky globals really are. There are some problems though where globals make a
good case for themselves: for logging frameworks, for intrusive performance
profiling, for registration to facilitate dynamic object construction, and so
on. Some may still be against globals in these contexts, but hopefully
reasonable people can agree to disagree.

## Keep calm and follow along

You can clone a repo that has the source code necessaary to reproduce these
issues [here](github link). The first example that causes a segfault is in a
directory called `minimal`; you can build it by `cd`ing into that directory and
running `../build.sh`.

## Global informants

To try to understand what's going on, the first thing we need is more
information. Segfaults suggest that is being destroyed incorrectly, but we know
that a standard library class like `string` will not have bugs of this
magnitude. We can clearly see potential for multiple strings to be constructed,
so let's see where each global is being consructed and destructed. We replace
our global `string` class with a class that I use (with variants) often:

{% highlight cpp linenos %}
struct Informer {
  Informer() {
    std::cerr << "ctor " << this << "\n";
  }
  Informer *get() { return this; }

  ~Informer() {
    std::cerr << "dtor " << this << "\n";
  }
};
{% endhighlight %}

You can build this example in the `informer` sub-directory. Building and
running, we see:

```
ctor 0x602193
ctor 0x602193
0x602193
0x602193
dtor 0x602193
dtor 0x602193
```

This is pretty crazy stuff. That means that our constructor is run twice at the
exact same place in memory, and then the same with our destructors. The second
constructor call will perform a second heap allocation and then overwrite the
pointer that the `string` contains, which means that memory will be lost
forever. It's not immediately clear whether the second destructor will free
memory at the same location twice, or at a complete garbage location,
but it's definitely not happening anywhere good. Can we try to understand why
this is happening?

## Linker 100 (`--Linker 101`)

We know that we have linked a static and dynamic library against our executable.
When you link against a static library, the linker sees what symbols (variables,
functions, classes, etc) are require by your executable, it sees if the static
library defines any of those symbols, and if it does it simply copies and pastes
the machine code from the static library into your executable.

With a dynamic library, the linker merely sees that the dynamic library provides
the definition to certain symbols, it ticks off that box, and does nothing else.
When you run the program, it's now the dynamic loader's responsibility to load
up that shared library and make the definition of the symbol available.
